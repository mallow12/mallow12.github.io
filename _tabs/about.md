# HI
I’m Abdullah Quadri, a penetration tester and also an aspiring SOC analyst. I love diving into systems, finding vulnerabilities, and figuring out how to fix them. This site is where I’ll be sharing my work — whether it’s projects I’ve built, writeups on interesting challenges I’ve faced, or just things I’ve learned along the way. I enjoy digging into Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, solving real-world security problems, and building tools to make security easier and more effective.

So feel free to browse around and hit me up if you want to chat about cybersecurity or collaborate on a project!
